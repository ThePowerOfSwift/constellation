# VR-iOS-Experiment

A simple Virtual Reality proof-of-concept app written in Swift for iOS 8.
SceneKit is used to generate a scene containing a bouncing 
[Boing Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) with a flame particle
effect. Two `SCNView` views are used to create a stereoscopic view of the
scene. Core Motion is used to track the user's head movements as they look
around.

You'll need some kind of head-mount (maybe 
[Google Cardboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard) or
a [Stooksy VR-Spektiv](http://www.stooksy.com/)?)
or a pair of [loupes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loupe), and, obviously,
an [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/).
